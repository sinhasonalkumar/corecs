/*
 
Subarray whose sum is closest to K
Given an array of positive and negative integers and an integer K. 
The task is to find the subarray which has its sum closest to k. 
In case of multiple answers, print any one.
Note: Closest here means abs(sum-k) should be minimal.

Examples:

Input: a[] = { -5, 12, -3, 4, -15, 6, 1 }, K = 2
Output: 1
The subarray {-3, 4} or {1} has sum = 1 which is the closest to K.

Input: a[] = { 2, 2, -1, 5, -3, -2 }, K = 7
Output: 6
Here the output can be 6 or 8
The subarray {2, 2, -1, 5} gives sum as 8 which has abs(8-7) = 1
which is same as that of the subarray {2, -1, 5} which has abs(6-7) = 1.
